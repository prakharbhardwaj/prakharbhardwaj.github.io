- This project is completely automated, from the expansion of the railway tracks(by the heat generated due to the friction between the railway tracks and the train) to the lubrication of the track.
- Labour and the number of man-hours removal has been the main and focused objective.
- Accuracy is also managed while creating this project and all the extreme cases are handled like technical failures and environmental issues such that we donâ€™t receive faultily values.
